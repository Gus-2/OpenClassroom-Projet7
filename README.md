## Description

The Go4Lunch app is a collaborative project that is used by company employees. This app allows the user to search nearby restaurants and to select the desired one. When a user has chosen the dining location, all of his colleagues are informed. Simultaneously, itâ€™s possible to consult the restaurants selected by the co-workers in order to join them. 

Shortly before lunch, the app notifies every user to invite them to to meet up.
